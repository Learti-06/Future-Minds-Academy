                <p class="about-p1">In this project I talked about <b><i>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro &#128125;</i></b>.
                    I started this project in the first week of the course and as I said at the beginning I talked about
                    Cristiano Ronaldo &#9917; which team he plays for, what kind of medals and cups he has won. I have put some photos, 
                    an audio and a video with the best goals of Cristiano Ronaldo and you can click on the link below the video to see
                    Cristiano Ronaldo's instagram. &#127967;</p>
